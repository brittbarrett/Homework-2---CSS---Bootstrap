              My name is Brittanie Barrett and I am twenty-five years old originally from Palos Verdes Estates, California, now living in Denver, Colorado. I graduated from Santa Clara University in 2017 with my degree in Technology Marketing, where I spent six of those months studying in Rome, Italy. After school I decided to move out to Denver solely based on my love for skiing and wanting to explore a completely new location. 
              <br>
              My first job out of college was a riveting one where I sold hair straighteners at a booth at Sam's Club seven days a week. Yep, glamorous! After six weeks of that, I was fortunate to get a job working for a company that utilized their own platform to create online digital campaigns for various types of companies in order for them to engage with their consumers/fans in exchange for their personal data. I was assigned to our sports accounts as that is a major interest of mine and was lucky to work with my dream clients such as the NHL, NFL, and PGA Tour. 
              <br>
              After two and a half years of being a client success manager for these awesome clients, I decided I wanted to go into web development and applied to D.U's full stack program. I am excited to expand my coding knowledge and start a career in web development afterwards!
